# PINN Damped Oscillator

A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) implementation for solving the damped harmonic oscillator equation. This project demonstrates how neural networks can learn to approximate solutions to differential equations while respecting the underlying physics.

## üéØ Problem Statement

We solve the damped harmonic oscillator equation:

$$\frac{d^2x}{dz^2} + 2\xi\frac{dx}{dz} + x = 0$$

with initial conditions:
- $x(0) = 0.7$
- $\frac{dx}{dz}(0) = 1.2$

The damping ratio Œæ varies in the range [0.1, 0.4], and we solve the equation on the domain z ‚àà [0, 20].
